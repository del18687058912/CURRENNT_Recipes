depth: recipes to train highway network with different depth
   hs**: highway single-stream network
   hm**: highway multi-stream network
   	 each directory contains a createWeightMask.py that generates
 	 the weight mask to implement the multi-stream network
   ds**: feedforward single-stream network

   

rnn_highway: receipts to train RNN plus highway networks
   R-B:  RNN baseline
   R-D:  deep RNN network
   R-FF: RNN + deep feedforward layers
   R-HS: RNN + deep highway layers (single-stream)
